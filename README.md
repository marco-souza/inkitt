# Inkitt Test

This test aims get a html text from an endpoint and transpile the html text in to Native Components, **not as a webview**.

For solve this task I used :

- the open-source component `react-native-htmlview` made by **jsdf** in https://github.com/jsdf/react-native-htmlview#install.
- `axios` for http requests

I also made a **estimative of how much you will time spent reading the text**. For this calculation I used the Speed reading of **200 wpm** (words per minute), because it's the [speed of an average reader](http://www.readingsoft.com/).
